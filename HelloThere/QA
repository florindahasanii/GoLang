1.Where does a Go program start?

2.What does the fmt package provide?

3.Where must opening braces { be placed to avoid syntax errors?
An opening brace must be on the same line as func, rather than on an separate line.

For example:
      Correct:
     func main(){
                }
      Wrong: 
     func main()
              {
              }
